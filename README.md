# TF-DogBreed-Classificationn

End-to-end Multi-class Dog Breed Classification
This notebook build an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub

https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras

1. Problem
Identifying the breed of a dog given by image of a dog.

2. Data
The data using is from Kaggle.com

https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data

3. Evaluation
The evaluation is file with prediction probability for each dog breed of test image

4. Features
Some information about data:

Dealing with unstructured data, best will be to use deep learning/transfer learning.
There are 120 breeds of dogs, this means 120 different classes
There are around 10,000+ images in training set(images have labels)
There are around 10,000+ images in test set(images dont have labels - predicting target..)
